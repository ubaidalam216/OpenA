              <p>If you've landed on this tutorial, chances are that you're already familiar with ChatGPT or OpenAI APIs, so I won't go into the details of their history.

              
                The GPT-3.5-Turbo Model is OpenAI's latest and most advanced language model, which powers the popular ChatGPT. Thanks to its capabilities, anyone now has the theoretical opportunity to build their own chatbot that can be just as powerful as ChatGPT.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The new GPT-3.5-Turbo model can now accept a series of messages as input, unlike the previous version that only allowed a single text prompt. This capability unlocks some interesting features, such as the ability to store prior responses or query with a predefined set of instructions with context. This is likely to improve the generated response, and I will demonstrate these in later section.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 class="sm:text-2xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-2 text-white">Comparison between GPT-3.5-Turbo vs GPT-3</h1>
                <p>The GPT-3.5-Turbo Model is a superior option compared to the GPT-3 Model, as it offers better performance across all aspects while being 10 times cheaper per token. Moreover, you can still perform single-turn tasks with only a minor adjustment to the original query prompt, while taking advantage of the discounted price offered by the GPT-3.5-Turbo Model.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The following example illustrates the difference between the message-style query used by the new GPT-3.5-Turbo Model and the old prompt-style query. With the new model, we can incorporate more context and even prior responses into the conversation.
                    </li>
                
                </ul>

                
                

                <p>Unless for some highly specialized use cases, it is advisable for everyone to adopt the new model for all future implementations.</p>
