            <p>OpenAI held its annual DevDay conferenceand used it as an opportunity to announce a raft of changes to ChatGPT and other products, including wholesale price reductions for developers and a brand new language model for the chatbot called Turbo. Here's what it is and how the key GPT-4 Turbo vs GPT-4 differences you should about.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GPT Turbo is a more advanced version of GPT-4 with a much larger context window. OpenAI has also launched an API you can use to build assistants and a way to make custom versions of ChatGPT.</li>
                <li>However, the changes aren’t currently available to all ChatGPT users. For each of the below changes/announcements, we’ve provided information on which account holders can access the different language models.</li>
                <li>GPT-4 Turbo is the latest language model to be released by ChatGPT owner OpenAI. It’s more powerful than the previous two language models that were used to power ChatGPT, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.</li>
                <li>ChatGPT has famously struggled to give accurate answers on events that happened after its training data set was cut off, which was initially September 2021, but this was extended to January 2022.</li>
                <li>However, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo chatbot has knowledge of events up until April 2023. In the wake of Elon Musk's xAI launching a chatbot boasting access to real time information, this is a key update in the budding Grok vs ChatGPT rivalry.</li>
                <li>GPT-4 Turbo can accept images as inputs as well as text-to-speech prompts. However, the drop-down menu that ChatGPT Plus has been using to switch between other OpenAI apps like DALLE-3, is being retired. Now, ChatGPT will work out what sort of output you need based on your prompts.</li>
                <li>GPT-4 Turbo also has an enlarged 128K context window, which helps it take prompts equivalent to around 300 pages of text. In short, GPT-4 Turbo vs GPT-4 is a straightforward win for the newer model, but there's so much more to it than that.</li>

            </ul>
            <h1 class="sm:text-2xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-2 text-white">Who can access GPT-4 Turbo?  </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenAI says that “GPT-4 Turbo is available for all paying developers to try by passing GPT-4-1106-preview in the API”, and revealed that the company plans to release “the stable production-ready model in the coming weeks.</li>
                <li>This means that the language model is only available as a preview right now. I the pattern of its prior releases continues, ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers will be the first to gain full access.</li>

            </ul>
            <h1 class="sm:text-2xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-2 text-white">GPT 4 Turbo vs GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 Turbo: How ChatGPT's Models Compare </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a number of key differences between OpenAI's models. GPT-4 Turbo is a significant upgrade on its sister model GPT-4 – which itself differs quite greatly from GPT-3.5, the language model that powered ChatGPT when it was first launched back in November 2022.

                </li>
                <li>Along with the release of GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI has also released a new version of GPT-3.5, called GPT-3.5 Turbo, which has a 16K context window by default and exhibits improved instruction following.
